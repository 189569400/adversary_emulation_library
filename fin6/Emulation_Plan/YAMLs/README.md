# Machine-Readable FIN6 Emulation Plans

The universal, technology agnostic version of the FIN6 emulation plan YAML is provided [here](fin6/Emulation_Plan/FIN6.yaml). This folder will store versions of this file ported to work with specific runners (such as automated agents like [CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) or other breach simulation frameworks).
