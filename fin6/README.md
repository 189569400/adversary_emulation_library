# FIN6 Adversary Emulation

This repository contains an adversary emulation plan for [FIN6](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/). This is the first emulation plan in a [library](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library) published by MITRE Engenuity's [Center for Threat Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/center-for-threat-informed-defense/) in cooperation with our participants.

The corresponding blog post dives into the components of this plan and explains how they may be used to perform adversary emulation exercises: [TODO: Link to blog post]
