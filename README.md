# CTID Adversary Emulation Library



## Philosophy 

In collaboration with Center participants, the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID) has developed these adversary emulations plans to document and distribute red team resources that are based on known-adversary behaviors. This approach empowers defenders to operationalize cyber threat intelligence to better understand and combat adversaries and their movements. Rather than focusing on static signatures, these intelligence-driven emulation plans provide a highly structured and repeatable means to test and tune defensive capabilities and products against the dynamic TTPs of real threat actors and malware.

## Adversary Emulation Background

Adversary emulation enables organizations to view their security through the eyes of a cyber adversary with the goal of improving defenses across the adversaryâ€™s lifecycle (i.e. not just the final actions of the adversary achieving their operational objective, but every distinct behavior, that could have been detected and/or mitigated, leading up to that point). Each emulation plan is rooted in intelligence reports and other artifacts that capture and describe breaches and campaigns publicly attributed to a specific named threat actor.

To develop each plan, we research and model each threat actor, focusing not only on what they do (ex: gather credentials from victims) but also how (using what specific tools/utilities/commands?) and when (during what stage of a breach?). We then develop emulation content that mimics the underlying behaviors utilized by the threat actor (i.e. not a verbatim representation, rather capturing the pertinent elements that accurately generate appropriate test telemetry for defenders). This approach results in nuanced emulation plans, each that captures unique scenarios and perspectives that we can leverage as threat-informed defenders. 

## Getting Started

Each emulation plan focuses on a specific named threat actor. The README of each individual plan provides an intelligence overview of the actor (who they target, how, and why) as well as the scope of their activity (i.e. breadth of techniques and malware used). All presented information is cited back to relevant publicly available cyber threat intelligence and communicated and annotated via [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).

Within each emulation plan, the operational flow provides a high-level summary of the captured scenario(s). These scenarios will vary based on the adversary and corresponding available intelligence, but typically follow sequential progression of how the actor breaches then works towards achieving their operational objectives (espionage, data/system destruction, etc.) within a victim environment. 

The content to execute the scenario(s) is broken down into step-by-step procedures provided in both human and machine-readable formats. Emulated scenarios can be executed end-to-end or as individual tests. The human readable formats provide additional relevant background where possible as well as any setup prerequisites, while the machine-readable format is designed to be parsed by an automatic agent (ex: [CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera), though both forms of content can similarly be parsed and run by other C2 frameworks). Please see the emulation plan data dictionary for a more detailed breakdown of the fields of the machine-readable format.
